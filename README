C++ Seminar
I [Christian R. Shelton] will be offering a one-hour-per-week seminar on "advanced" C++ during the Spring 2012 quarter. It will be as the course CS290 (directed studies) in order to be able to reserve a room. The only work will be filling out a survey at the end of the course. Please attend, even if only as a auditor. You don't need to worry about signing up; I'll explain on the first seminar.

The course has been scheduled:

    Wednesdays from 5pm - 6pm in Chung Hall, room 139


The first meeting will be on April 4th (10 total seminars with the last on June 6th). If this conflicts with something else in your schedule, I apologize. There is no time that will satisfy everyone's constraints, and classroom space on campus is scarse.

C++ usage has changed drastically over the past ten years with much more advanced use of templates, meta-programming, functors, and other high-level concepts becoming common. Last year, a new C++ standard (C++11, formerly C++0x) was released with many new and exciting changes to the language that follow these trends. Each week's seminar will be relatively self-contained and have "live programming" examples to illustrate C++11 and new ways of using C++. It should be fun and interactive. If you'd like to learn more about C++, I hope you attend.
